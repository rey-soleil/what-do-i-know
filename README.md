# What Do I Know?

What Do I Know? is a chatbot who acts like a podcast host, and you’re the guest. Over the course of a conversation with him, he’ll ask you about topics you’re interested in, push you to go deeper, and introduce new concepts to connect to ones you’ve mentioned. Simultaneously, he’ll summarize everything you’ve talked about so far.
